### Introduction

A PWA (Progressive Web App) is a type of web application that provides a user experience similar to a native app, 
allowing users to install it on their device for offline access, push notifications, and quick launch from the 
home screen. 

Built with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, PWAs run across all devices and platforms from a single 
codebase, adapting to device capabilities to provide a customized, reliable, and engaging experience.
