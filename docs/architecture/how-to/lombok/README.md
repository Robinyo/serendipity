## ❯ Introduction

Project Lombok is a popular Java library that uses annotations to automatically generate boilerplate code (like getters,
setters, constructors, toString, hashCode, equals) at compile time, significantly reducing repetitive code and making 
Java classes cleaner and more concise. 

It works by processing annotations during compilation, modifying the code's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to inject the 
needed methods, meaning no performance penalty at runtime as it's native Java code. Key features include @Getter, 
@Setter, @Builder, @Log, and @NonNull, integrating seamlessly with IDEs and build tools like Maven.
